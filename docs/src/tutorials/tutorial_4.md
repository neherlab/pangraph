# Project the graph on a subset of strains.

- aim of the tutorial: show the marginalize command
- test on a different dataset: klebsiella. Download data (chromosomes) and generate the pangraph.
- project on a subset of strains that are more similar. This removes transitive edges.
- visualize with bandage full graph vs pairwise comparison. (show a dotplot to see the common part?)

## Marginalize the graph on a subset of strains

## Export and visualize with bandage. Comparison with full graph
